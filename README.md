## 📚 Learning Resources

### DSA Learning
- Problem-solving patterns from coding bootcamps
- LeetCode problems
- Common interview questions
- Algorithm optimization techniques

### Full-Stack JavaScript
- **4-Week Comprehensive Program** (1.5 hours/day)
- JavaScript fundamentals & advanced concepts
- React Hooks & performance optimization
- Next.js SSR/SSG/ISR
- Node.js & backend development
- 75+ interview questions with detailed answers

## 🎯 Key Topics Covered

### Data Structures & Algorithms
- **Big O Notation** - Time and space complexity analysis
- **Frequency Counter Pattern** - Using objects/maps to count occurrences
- **Multiple Pointers** - Two-pointer technique for array problems
- **Sliding Window** - Window-based solutions for subarrays/substrings
- **Data Structure Implementations** - Building DSA from scratch
- **Algorithm Analysis** - Understanding trade-offs and optimizations

### Full-Stack Development
- **JavaScript Core** - Arrow functions, closures, promises, async/await, event loop
- **Advanced JS** - Prototypes, classes, destructuring, spread/rest operators
- **React** - Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, custom hooks), performance optimization
- **Next.js** - SSR/SSG/ISR, data fetching, API routes, optimization
- **Node.js** - Modules, file system, HTTP servers, Express.js patterns

## 🎯 Learning Path

1. **DSA Practice** - Build strong problem-solving foundation
2. **Full-Stack Recap** - Refresh & upskill JavaScript ecosystem (alongside DSA)
3. **Interview Prep** - Use interview question banks for both tracks

> **Note:** The `fullstack-recap/` module is designed to run parallel to your DSA learning, requiring just 1.5 hours/day over 4 weeks.

Happy coding! 🎯
