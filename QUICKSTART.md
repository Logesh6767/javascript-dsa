# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

Welcome to your JavaScript Data Structures & Algorithms learning environment!

## How to Run

### Method 1: Interactive Menu
```bash
cd javascript-dsa
node index.js
```
This will show you an interactive menu to choose what to run.

### Method 2: Run Individual Files
```bash
# Run specific implementations
node data-structures/arrays/implementation.js
node data-structures/stacks/implementation.js
node algorithms/sorting/sorting-algorithms.js
node problems/easy/array-problems.js

# Or using npm scripts
npm run run:ds arrays/implementation.js
npm run run:algo sorting/sorting-algorithms.js
npm run run:problem easy/array-problems.js
```

## What's Included

✅ **Ready to Use:**
- Arrays implementation and problems
- Stack implementation  
- Sorting algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick)
- Array-based coding problems
- Utility functions for testing and performance measurement

🔄 **Coming Soon:**
- Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs
- Searching algorithms, Recursion, Dynamic Programming
- More coding problems (Medium & Hard)

## File Structure
```
📁 data-structures/     # Data structure implementations
📁 algorithms/          # Algorithm implementations  
📁 problems/            # Coding problems by difficulty
📁 utils/               # Helper functions
📄 index.js             # Interactive runner
📄 README.md            # Main documentation
```

## Tips for Learning
1. Start with `index.js` for guided learning
2. Read the README in each folder for theory
3. Run the implementations to see tests and examples
4. Modify the code to experiment and learn
5. Add your own problems and solutions

Happy coding! 🎯
