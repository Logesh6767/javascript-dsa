# Arrays in JavaScript

Arrays are one of the most fundamental data structures. They store elements in contiguous memory locations and provide indexed access.

## Key Concepts
- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Access: O(1)
  - Search: O(n)
  - Insertion: O(n) worst case, O(1) at end
  - Deletion: O(n) worst case, O(1) at end

## Common Operations
- Push/Pop (end operations)
- Shift/Unshift (beginning operations)
- Splice (insert/remove at index)
- Slice (extract portion)
- Map/Filter/Reduce (functional operations)
