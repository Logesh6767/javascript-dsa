## 🚀 Getting Started

### Day 1: Arrow Functions & `this` Binding

```bash
cd fullstack-recap/js-fundamentals
node 01-arrow-functions.js
```

**What you'll learn:**
- Arrow function syntax and use cases
- Lexical `this` binding
- When NOT to use arrow functions
- Common interview questions

### Study Approach

Each file follows this structure:

1. **Theory** (20-30 min)
   - Concept explanations
   - Code examples
   - Common patterns

2. **Exercises** (30-40 min)
   - Hands-on problems
   - TODO sections to complete
   - Practice problems

3. **Interview Questions** (15-20 min)
   - Common interview questions
   - Code challenges
   - Conceptual questions

## 📅 Weekly Breakdown

### Week 1: JavaScript Fundamentals
Focus on core JavaScript concepts that are frequently asked in interviews:
- Functions (arrow, regular, IIFE)
- Asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, async/await)
- Array methods and functional programming
- Closures and scope
- Event loop and concurrency

### Week 2: Advanced JavaScript & Node.js
Deep dive into advanced topics and Node.js basics:
- Prototypes and inheritance
- ES6+ features (classes, destructuring, etc.)
- Node.js module system
- File operations
- Building HTTP servers

### Week 3: React Fundamentals
Master React hooks and component patterns:
- Component lifecycle
- useState, useEffect, useContext
- Custom hooks
- State management patterns
- Performance optimization

### Week 4: Next.js & Full-Stack
Learn server-side rendering and full-stack patterns:
- Routing in Next.js
- SSR vs SSG vs ISR
- API routes
- Data fetching patterns
- Performance and optimization

## 💡 Study Tips

1. **Code Along:** Type out every example
2. **Experiment:** Modify code to see what happens
3. **Debug:** Use console.log() liberally
4. **Review:** Revisit concepts that don't click immediately
5. **Build:** Apply concepts in small projects

## 🎯 Key Focus Areas

Based on your mentioned weak points:

### Promises & Async/Await
- `js-fundamentals/02-promises.js` (Day 2)
- `js-fundamentals/03-async-await.js` (Day 3)

### Arrow Functions & `this`
- `js-fundamentals/01-arrow-functions.js` (Day 1)

### Next.js SSR
- `nextjs/02-rendering/` (Day 23)
- `nextjs/03-data-fetching/` (Day 24)

### API Routes
- `nextjs/04-api-routes/` (Day 25)

### Node.js Fundamentals
- `nodejs/01-basics.js` through `nodejs/03-http-server.js` (Days 11-13)
